    "\n",
    "**GPUs are optimized for performing matrix operations in parallel.** Although we call them \"graphics processing units\", they are actually very powerful processors that can be used for any kind of parallel computation, including training deep neural networks. In fact, data science is one of the most common applications of GPUs today, as can be seen by the revenue of companies like NVIDIA over the past few years. NVIDIA is a monopolist in the GPU market - in 2023, the company owned 92% of the data center GPU market share. As for 31 July, the 2024 revenue of NVIDIA was 60.92 billion USD, while the total revenue of 2020 was $10.92 billion. If someone benefits from the current deep learning hype, it is certainly NVIDIA.\n",

That's one of the reasons why we use a dataloader and process the data in batches.\n",
